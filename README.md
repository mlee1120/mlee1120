Hi, I’m Michael Lee (@mlee1120)
I am a graduate student at RIT pursuing a second M.S. degree in Computer Science.

I received my bachelor's degree and first master's degree in Biomechatronics Engineering at National Taiwan University. During my undergraduate years, I cultivated multidisciplinary engineering knowledge and learned C++ as my first programming language. In my graduate years, I managed to think rationally, work on projects independently, and solve problems by scientific methods. I am currently enhancing my computer science knowledge and programming skills (Java/Python/C++) at RIT.

Having strong interest in computer graphics, I have accomplished several projects on related topics, including modeling, rendering, animation, and motion capture. I would like to start a career in fields, including but not limited to animation and video game. I am looking forward to dedicating my experiences and skills to a team having great potential as a software engineer. As a self-motivated and responsible person, I believe that my eagerness to learn new knowledge and technologies will make me a promising employee.
