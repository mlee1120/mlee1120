<p align="justify">Hi, I’m Michael Lee (@mlee1120).</p>
<p align="justify">I am a recent Computer Science graduate from RIT.</p>

<p align="justify">I obtained my bachelor's degree and first master's degree in Biomechatronics Engineering at National Taiwan University, where I cultivated multidisciplinary engineering knowledge and learned C++ as my first programming language. I also managed to think rationally, work on projects both independently and on a team, and resolve problems by scientific methods. Pursing a second master’s degree in Computer Science at RIT allowed me to enhance my problem solving and programming skills (C++/Java/Python) and knowledge of algorithms, data structures, which prepared me for an early career as a software engineer.</p>

<p align="justify">Having strong interest in computer graphics, I have accomplished several projects on related topics, including modeling, rendering, animation, and motion capture. I would like to start a career in fields, including but not limited to animation and video game. I am looking forward to dedicating my experiences and skills to a team having great potential as a software engineer. As a self-motivated and responsible person, I believe that my eagerness to learn new knowledge and technologies will make me a promising employee.</p>
